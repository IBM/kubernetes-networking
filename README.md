# Kubernetes Networking

The Kubernetes Networking series consists of the following topics:

1. **Kubernetes Networking 101** (60 mins), you will use different ways to control traffic on a Kubernetes cluster with Service types, Ingress, Network Policy and Calico.
2. **Kubernetes Network Security using a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** (90 mins), you will deploy a guestbook application to a Kubernetes cluster in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Gen2, you will create the VPC, add a subnet, attach a public gateway, and update a security group with rules to allow inbound traffic to the guestbook application.
3. **[Istio](https://ibm.github.io/istio101/)**, use Istio to manage network traffic, load balance across microservices, enforce access policies, verify service identity, and more.

This series of workshops on Kubernetes Networking is accompanied by a [lecture on Kubernetes Networking](pdf/KubernetesNetworking-Lecture.pdf).

Kubernetes Networking is part of the series `Kubernetes Security`, which includes:

1. Kubernetes Security,
1. Kubernetes Networking,
1. Kubernetes Storage,
1. Kubernetes Automation (DevOps, IaC, CI/CD).

## Next steps 

Continue your learning by visiting the [Istio workshop](https://ibm.github.io/istio101/). With Istio, you can manage network traffic, load balance across microservices, enforce access policies, verify service identity, and more.
